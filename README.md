# Nextory | نيكستوري  
**A youth-focused social enterprise providing career guidance, mentorship, and community-based experiences for high school and early university students.**

---

## 💡 Project Idea
**Nextory** is an educational and community-driven initiative designed to help young people discover their strengths, explore career paths, and make confident decisions about their futures.

The project addresses major challenges youth face today — career confusion, lack of mentorship, and limited access to real-world guidance — by building a supportive ecosystem that blends **offline experiences** with **continuous online engagement**.

Nextory focuses on establishing a complete guidance and development journey through:

- Strong brand identity and clear community presence.  
- Mentorship programs with professionals from diverse fields.  
- Career guidance workshops introducing industries and future skills.  
- Talking Circles (safe emotional support spaces).  
- English Clubs and soft skills activities.  
- Bootcamps with mini-projects to apply learning.  
- A growing online community and future digital platform.

Nextory transforms career guidance into an accessible, supportive, and empowering experience for youth across Egypt.
